## Lossless-Huffman-Encoding-Decoding-Tool
This project is based on Huffman Coding algorithm to encode and decode files and documents with negligible loss. This project also marks the start of my JavaScript journey from understanding and learning the core principles and topics to building this proprietary tool.


## Work-plan
1. Creating the Github repository.
2. Understanding huffman coding algorithm.
